# Task retrieval
Our package allows to easily test the gene encodings on many tasks from varying sources and type.
While the package itself does not include the tasks directly we provide an easy command line interface
to download and populate a folder with the tasks in the appropriate format see [here](../scripts/tasks_retrival/).
For task descriptions see [here](task_descriptions.xlsx)

Note the the scripts might be used to download data from various sources to do so the user needs to explicitly allow this,
use this only if you trust the urls appearing in the scripts.
